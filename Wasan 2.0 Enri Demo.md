# **Wasan 2.0: Enri Visualization – AI Safety & Finite Responsibility Framework**

### **A Foundational Pillar of Ghost Drift: Defining Truth through Japanese Mathematical Ethics**

[**🌐 View Live Demo**](https://ghostdrifttheory.github.io/Wasan-Enri-ADIC-Demo/)

## **📖 Overview**

**Wasan 2.0 (Enri Kai)** is a foundational pillar of the **GhostDrift** framework, providing a finite-responsibility model for **AI safety and accountability**.

It is a digital re-implementation of "Enri" (the Circle Principle) developed by the Edo-era Japanese mathematical giant **Seki Takakazu**. While Western mathematics historically relied on "Limits" and "Infinity" to approach truth, Wasan perfected a **Finite Procedure** to trap truth within a rigorous "Cage" (Threshold). This project serves as technical evidence that the core concepts of **Responsibility Engineering**—guaranteeing the finite world—originate from Japanese mathematical traditions.

## **💡 Why it Matters: The Theoretical Pillar of AI Safety**

In modern AI systems, "hallucination" is essentially a **boundary violation**. Traditional AI tries to predict the "limit" of truth, often overstepping its verified knowledge.

* **The "Limit" Model (Western OS):** Truth is an infinite destination. Because it is never fully reached, the system is forced to "guess" or "compromise," leading to hallucinations.  
* **The "Cage" Model (Wasan/GhostDrift OS):** Truth is "trapped" between an upper and lower bound. We do not trust infinity; we trust the **Finite Closure** (the Gap) that we can verify here and now.

By adopting this **Threshold-based OS**, we define truth as a verifiable range. This makes it mathematically impossible for the system to lie, as it explicitly identifies what it *does not* know.

## **⚙️ Core Mechanism: ADIC & The Wasan Ledger**

This demo visualizes the **GhostDrift Protocol** applied to the safety of information:

1. Polygon Carving (The Procedure):  
   Following Seki's method, the system uses inscribed and circumscribed polygons to define the boundaries of $\\pi$. This is a purely finite process.  
2. The ADIC Ledger (Daifukucho):  
   Each calculation step is recorded in an immutable ledger. This "Open Procedure" mirrors the Japanese Sangaku tradition, where mathematical proofs were hung in shrines for public verification.  
3. Gap Inspection (Admission of Unknown):  
   The system displays the "Gap"—the area not yet determined. Responsibility Engineering dictates that a system is only allowed to answer when this gap is within verified bounds.

## **👁️ Features**

* **Interactive Soroban Slider:** Re-live the procedure by increasing polygon sides from 6 to 192\.  
* **Edo-Cyber Visualizer:** A unique aesthetic blending *Zen Old Mincho* calligraphy with high-tech SVG geometry.  
* **Inequality Monitor:** Real-time tracking of the Lower Bound, Upper Bound, and the Gap.  
* **Anti-Fake Decree:** A section explaining how this finite method serves as the theoretical foundation for preventing AI hallucinations.

## **⚓ The Origin of Responsibility Engineering**

**Responsibility Engineering** is not just a theory; it is a Japanese-origin engineering discipline. Wasan 2.0 provides the historical and logical proof that:

1. **Truth is a Procedure:** Not a destination at infinity, but a series of finite, verifiable steps.  
2. **Finite Accountability:** Responsibility can only be taken for what is within the "Cage."

This project is the theoretical anchor for the **AI Accountability Project**, proving that safety boundaries can be mathematically defined and visually inspected.
